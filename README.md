Hello!

--------------------OVERVIEW--------------------
This is the source code for a website where a user can manage their workouts.
A user can create a new account, create, retrieve, update, and delete their 
workouts, exercises associated with a workout, and sets associated with an exercise.


----------------------ABOUT---------------------
This project was made using Java and the Spring Boot framework for the backend and Thymeleaf for the frontend. 
While Thymeleaf is a useful framework. To be able to realize and make a feature complete product,
I am currently learning React and TypeScript. Due to some matters relating to my visa, development 
has stopped for the time being, but should resume soon. 

Thank you for taking time to read this.
